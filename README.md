- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Klaus-Nomi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Shotcut
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Linux Mint

Hi, I started in 1977 with an Tandy 
from Radio Shack which had an 8-bit 
processor, floppy-string storage, an
Zilog-Processor and the OS was CP/M.

Then I switched to MS-DOS, but that
was only in 1986, not before. I went
the last 36 years with MS-DOS and
Windows and switched last week to Linux Mint.

What a relief, God, what a relief it is.
